Impacts of COVID-19 on Small Businesses

The Data:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Sourced from the OIET (https://tracktherecovery.org/)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Dataset sourced from Womply, a small business industry agnostic platform.
 500000+ businesses, 26k zup codes, 124b in annualized revenue processed.
 Relatively confident that this is a reasonable sample of the space
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I've restricted my analysis to california for a couple of reasons, primarily
 because it's my home state, also because we had stricter/more clearly communica
ted lockdown policy, which I hope leads to a sharper visible discontinuity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For this analysis, I've utilized both the number of business open and revenue,
 as a seven-day moving average seasonally adjusted and indexed to January
 2020.
 Both variables are in terms of percent change relative to January 2020
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The income catagories are based on zipcode median income, with high income
 being 4th quartile, middle being second and third, and low being first.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I also generated a post-lockdown dummy, which reads zero until 4/19/21,
 where california's first shelter-in-place order went into force.

Techniques applied
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
RDD: Seemed like a pretty good option, as we have a sudden shock in the
 form of a lockdown order and pretty granular (daily) data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
diff-in-diff: Can we combine the initial RDD and also differentiate by income
 level? What do we expect to find? Will businesses in lower income areas
 get hit harder? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
OLS.
 The bread and butter.
 Of course we're gonna use OLS

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Our initial RDD, undifferentiated by income, shows a sharp increase in post-lock
down closures, with a nearly 30% difference across our discontinuity.
